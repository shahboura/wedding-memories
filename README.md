## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone and install**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd wedding-memories
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment and settings**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Cloudinary credentials
   # Edit config.ts for couple names and features
   ```

3. **Start development**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # Open http://localhost:3010
   ```

### Configuration Files

**Environment Variables (.env)**

_For Cloudinary Storage:_

```bash
# Cloudinary Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=wedding
```

_For S3/Wasabi Storage:_

```bash
# AWS S3 / Wasabi Configuration
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_BUCKET=your_bucket_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.wasabisys.com  # Optional: for Wasabi or other S3-compatible services
```

**App Configuration (config.ts)**

```typescript
export enum StorageProvider {
  Cloudinary = 'cloudinary',
  S3 = 's3',
  Local = 'local',
}

export const appConfig = {
  brideName: 'YourBrideName', // or set BRIDE_NAME env var
  groomName: 'YourGroomName', // or set GROOM_NAME env var
  guestIsolation: false, // or set GUEST_ISOLATION env var
  storage: StorageProvider.Cloudinary, // or set NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_PROVIDER env var
};
```

**Storage Providers**

- **Local**: Filesystem storage with no cloud dependencies — ideal for Docker / self-hosted deployments
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud-based media storage with automatic optimization, transformations, and blur placeholders for images/videos
- **S3/Wasabi**: Object storage compatible with AWS S3 API via secure proxy with request deduplication and stream handling
- **Seamless Switching**: Change providers via `NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_PROVIDER` env var or `config.ts` — no code changes required
- **Smart Media Handling**: Automatic optimization for Cloudinary, proxy-based serving for S3/Wasabi with progressive video loading
- **Feature Parity**: Download, external links, and all functionality work identically across providers

**S3/Wasabi Presigned URL Architecture**

- **Unified Upload Endpoint**: `/api/upload` handles all media with smart routing based on storage provider
- **Direct Browser Uploads**: Large files upload directly to S3, bypassing Vercel's 10MB limit
- **Private Bucket Support**: Full support for private S3 buckets via presigned URLs
- **Secure Access**: Presigned read URLs (24h expiry) and write URLs (1h expiry)
- **Request Type Detection**: JSON metadata vs FormData automatically detected
- **Storage Agnostic**: Frontend code adapts automatically to configured storage provider
- **No 413 Errors**: Video files >10MB bypass server entirely for S3 uploads
- **Maintains Features**: All Cloudinary optimizations and S3 uploads work seamlessly

**Guest Isolation Mode**

- When `guestIsolation: true`, each guest only sees photos they uploaded
- When `guestIsolation: false`, all guests see all photos (default behavior)
- Server-side rendering shows empty gallery when isolation is enabled

## 📝 Development

```bash
pnpm dev         # Start development server (http://localhost:3010)
pnpm build       # Build for production
pnpm start       # Start production server
pnpm lint        # Run ESLint code linting

```

## 🚀 Deployment

Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new/clone) (recommended), Docker, or any platform supporting Next.js:

1. **Vercel (Recommended)**
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Configure environment variables in dashboard
   - Automatic deployments on push to main

2. **Docker (Self-Hosted)**

   ```bash
   # Copy and customise the env file
   cp .env.docker.example .env

   # Production
   docker compose up -d --build

   # Development (hot-reload)
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
   ```

   - Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_PROVIDER=local` by default — no cloud credentials needed
   - Uploaded media persists in a Docker named volume (`wedding-uploads`)
   - Set `BRIDE_NAME`, `GROOM_NAME`, `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`, etc. in `.env`
   - See `.env.docker.example` for all available options

3. **Other Platforms**
   - Ensure Node.js 18+ support
   - Configure all environment variables
   - Set build command: `pnpm build`
   - Set output directory: `.next`
